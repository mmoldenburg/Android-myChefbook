# CookBook_Chefkoch
This app is not intended for publication in the Google App Store, but is exclusively a practice project in the course of my studies.
The idea of the app is that recipes on chefkoch.de (selected here as an example) are read out with JSoup and transferred to an SQLite database. Optional extensions could be, for example, other recipe websites or also possibilities of their own capture of recipes using edit text modules, etc..

I will gladly accept suggestions for improvement, especially to continuously improve my programming skills and clean coding
